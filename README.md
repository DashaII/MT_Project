**Intro**
This project focuses on analyzing the results of the WMT23 conference, specifically evaluating
GPT4's performance in translating from English to Russian. The goals were to analyze the
translations provided by GPT4 for this language pair, identify errors present in the outputs, try to
generalize these errors, and develop a test suite to search for similar errors in the future.
